# Track Builder

This simple script helps with creating new tracks. To use this, run:

```sh
python game.py
```

This would open a pygame window, where you can click to draw new lines.
Once you are done, press <kbd>Space</kbd> to let the program close the track
and calculate the location to draw the lines.

Once you close the program, you should see a file called `lines.txt` which stores
the line data.
